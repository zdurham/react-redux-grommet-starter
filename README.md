# react-redux-grommet-starter

Starter files for bootcamp folks to play around with

## Purpose

This repo is to provide a minimal foundation for UNC-CH Trilogy Bootcamp students and instructional team members to tinker with react, redux, and react-router and potentially build out fully-fledged applications. For added flavoring grommet components have been used and everything has been styled using styled-components, to give students a taste of some possible solutions for managing styles in react and to experience a modern component library.
